241. The 3 steps of m-RNA maturation in eukaryotes?
5’ capping – 5’ and 7 –methylguasine phosphate group removed by enzyme
(phosphases) prevent ribonucleases attacking.
3’ polyadenylation – cleavage 3’ and add adenine residue make poly A tail.
RNA splicing – use of spliceosome remove introns and from m-RNA strands and join
extrons together to form mature m-RNA.

242. Explain principle of regulative embryonic development.
A fertilised ovum undergoes intermediate cleavage, produce blastomere, this is

capable of giving rise to a single embryo.

243. Okazaki fragments?
Short newly synthesised DNA fragments on lagging strand during DNA replication.

244. What is an enhancer?
A DNA sequence increase transcription level of gene nearby on same chromosome.

245. What is telomerase?
An enzyme which repairs telomere of chromosome.

246. Why eukaryotic m-RNA needs a cap?
Create mature m-RNA for transduction.

247. Types of microtubules in mitotic spindles?
Kinechore, polar, aster = microtubules

248. Plasma cells?
Differentiate B lymphocytes, makes single type antibody.

249. Polyspermy blocking mechanism?
Decrease number of sperm getting to fallopian tube.

250. Oocytes types of distribution:
Alecithal = no yolk
Mircolecthral = small yolk
Mesolectal = moderate yolk
Macrolectral = large yolk
